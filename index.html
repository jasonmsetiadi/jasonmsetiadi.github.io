Hi, I'm Jason. 
<span class="br"></span>
I love to design, build, and operate machine learning systems that solve real world problems.
<span class="br"></span> 
Currently, I work as an AI/ML engineer with over 3 years of industry experience across three companiesâ€”two in the tech sector and one in real estate. My work has primarily focused on applying large language models (LLMs) to extract structured data from unstructured sources such as text, images, and documents. I've also developed customer service chatbots aimed at improving user experience and operational efficiency.
<span class="br"></span>
I earned my Bachelor of Science in Statistics from the University of Minnesota in 2022, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
