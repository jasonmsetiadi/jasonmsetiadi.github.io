Hi, I'm Jason. I love to design, build, and operate machine learning systems.
<span class="br"></span> 
Currently, I am serving as the first and only Data Scientist / ML engineer at <a href="https://www.humanica.com/en/about-us/">DataOn Corp</a>, 
where I pioneered the development of their machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLM) systems. 
We apply these systems for HR use cases, such as employee attrition risk prediction and candidate recommendation through our ML systems, 
as well as job description and HR data analysis generation through our LLM systems <a href="https://youtu.be/wloTjPqpNGg?si=U8Hs5ZFkF60tjFyY">[Demo]</a>.
<span class="br"></span>
I graduated from University of Minnesota in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree and minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
