The ChatGPT interface resembles a chat application, allowing users to interact with the AI seamlessly. At the center of this interface is a text input box where users can type their queries. 

Here are some basic examples of how to utilize ChatGPT effectively:

### 1. Writing Assistance

</div>

Users can request help with writing essays, reports, or emails, making it a versatile tool for various writing tasks. 

### 2. Information Retrieval

</div>

ChatGPT can provide comprehensive information on a wide range of historical topics, offering quick access to reliable facts and knowledge. 
However, it's important to understand that the model's knowledge is limited to data available up until its training cutoff date. 
For real-time information or current events that occurred after this cutoff, additional tools are required - which we'll explore later in this guide.

### 3. Language Translation

</div>

The model can assist in translating text across different languages and can also be a valuable tool for learning new languages, facilitating communication and understanding in multilingual contexts.

## Tools

We have seen the general capabilities of ChatGPT's base model in the examples above. However, despite its impressive performance, the model still has inherent limitations that restrict its ability to perform certain types of tasks.

This is where tools come into play. The integration of various specialized tools helps bridge these limitations, significantly enhancing the model's capabilities and allowing it to perform more complex and powerful tasks. Let's explore these tools and how they extend ChatGPT's functionality:

### 1. File Uploads
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/chatgpt/file-upload.png" width="75%"/>
</div>

ChatGPT supports uploading various file formats, which can be categorized into two main types:

- **Images**: PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg), and non-animated GIF (.gif).
- **Text documents**: Including PDFs, spreadsheets (CSV/Excel), presentations, Microsoft Word documents, and text files

So far, we only know that ChatGPT can receive text inputs. However, it can also process images, introducing a new modality beyond just text. Text documents are still treated as text input, meaning any embedded images within them will not be processed. If you're working with scanned documents (which are essentially images), upload them as images rather than documents for better results.

This file upload tool enables three key types of tasks:

1. **Synthesis**: Combine or analyze information, such as comparing two documents or visualizing data from a spreadsheet.

2. **Transformation**: Reshape information from documents, like summarizing a complex research paper or rewriting a document in a specific style.

3. **Extraction**: Pull specific information from documents, such as finding references to a topic in a PDF or extracting metadata.
