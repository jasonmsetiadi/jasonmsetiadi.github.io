The ChatGPT interface resembles a chat application, allowing users to interact with the AI seamlessly. At the center of this interface is a text input box where users can type their queries. 

Here are some basic examples of how to utilize ChatGPT effectively:

### 1. Writing Assistance

</div>

Users can request help with writing essays, reports, or emails, making it a versatile tool for various writing tasks. 

### 2. Information Retrieval

</div>

ChatGPT can provide comprehensive information on a wide range of historical topics, offering quick access to reliable facts and knowledge. 
However, it's important to understand that the model's knowledge is limited to data available up until its training cutoff date. 
For real-time information or current events that occurred after this cutoff, additional tools are required - which we'll explore later in this guide.

### 3. Language Translation

The model can assist in translating text across different languages and can also be a valuable tool for learning new languages, facilitating communication and understanding in multilingual contexts.

## Tools

We have seen the general capabilities of ChatGPT's base model in the examples above. However, despite its impressive performance, the model still has inherent limitations that restrict its ability to perform certain types of tasks.

This is where tools come into play. The integration of various specialized tools helps bridge these limitations, significantly enhancing the model's capabilities and allowing it to perform more complex and powerful tasks. Let's explore these tools and how they extend ChatGPT's functionality:

### 1. File Uploads
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

ChatGPT currently supports file uploads for various formats, including images, text files, spreadsheets (CSV/Excel), presentations, documents, and PDFs. This capability enables users to perform several tasks:

1. **Synthesis**: Users can upload files to combine or analyze information, such as comparing two documents or visualizing data from a spreadsheet.

2. **Transformation**: Users can reshape information from documents, like summarizing a complex research paper or rewriting a document in a specific style.

3. **Extraction**: Users can pull specific information from documents, such as finding references to a topic in a PDF or extracting metadata.

However, it is important to note that ChatGPT cannot analyze images embedded in documents or presentations and only processes text in PDFs that contain images.

### 2. Search

</div>

The search tool effectively bridges ChatGPT's knowledge limitations regarding current events and up-to-date information. By integrating internet search capabilities, ChatGPT can access real-time data to provide more accurate and timely responses to your questions.
A key advantage of this feature is transparency - ChatGPT will provide links to the web sources it references, allowing you to verify information and explore topics further on your own. This makes the search tool particularly valuable for research, fact-checking, and staying informed about recent developments that occurred after the model's training cutoff date.

Here is one straightforward example of using the search tool to browse for daily news.
