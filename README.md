## [1. Graph-Based Active Learning Research Project](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/active_learning.html)
In this project I researched many graph-based active learning techniques that works alongside graph-based semi-supervised learning frameworks. Semi-supervised learning is a method of using a small subset of labeled data to predict the remaining/future unlabeled data. The idea behind graph-based active learning is to choose the most optimal points to label given a graph structure that represents the dataset. That way we can have a labeling approach that is more methodological than simply randomly sample points to label. The hope of this approach is to minimize number of labeled data while still obtaining a sufficiently high accuracy or some other performance metric.

The outcome of this research led me to build a python module for my research professor's ([*Dr. Jeff Calder*](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~jwcalder/)) graph-based semi-supervised learning package called [GraphLearning](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning), which can be viewed from the link by clicking the project title. Check out the link [here](https://github.com/jasonmsetiadi/UROP/blob/main/Signals_Bounds_VOPT.ipynb) if you are interested in learning more about how the active learning methods work through some visualtizations on a toy dataset.

## [2. Astronomy Active Learning Project](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/scope)
In this project, I worked as a undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Michael Coughlin's astronomy group called *Coughlin Multi-Messenger Astronomy Group*. In general, my work is about performing active learning to identify ambiguous light curve objects, from selecting points to label, labeling them by hand, and uploading the labeled data to the source website called [Fritz](https://fritz.science/). Some skills involved in this process include data manipulation using *Pandas* and usage of *Rest APIs* to create and filter processed data sets using a *MongoDB* framework. All work in this group can be viewed through the link on the project title that will lead to the github page. Some of my contributions include creating Python scripts to [find ambiguous objects](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/scope/blob/main/tools/scope_upload_disagreements.py), [upload labeled objects](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/scope/blob/main/tools/scope_upload_classification.py), as well as [download labeled objects](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/scope/blob/main/tools/scope_download_classification.py).
