Portofolio showcasing different projects I have done

## [1. Graph-Based Active Learning Research Project](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/active_learning.html)
In this project I researched many graph-based active learning techniques that works alongside graph-based semi-supervised learning frameworks. Semi-supervised learning is a method of using a small subset of labeled data to predict the remaining/future unlabeled data. The idea behind graph-based active learning is to choose the most optimal points to label given a graph structure that represents the dataset. That way we can have a labeling approach that is more methodological than simply randomly sample points to label. The hope of this approach is to minimize number of labeled data while still obtaining a sufficiently high accuracy or some other performance metric.

The outcome of this research led me to build a python module for my research professor's ([*Dr. Jeff Calder*](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~jwcalder/)) graph-based semi-supervised learning package called [**GraphLearning**](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning), which can be viewed from the link by clicking the project title. Check out the link [here](https://github.com/jasonmsetiadi/UROP/blob/main/Signals_Bounds_VOPT.ipynb) if you are interested in learning more about how the active learning methods work through some visualtizations on a toy dataset.

## 2. Astronomy Active Learning Project
In this project, I worked as a undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Michael Coughlin's astronomy group called *Coughlin Multi-Messenger Astronomy Group*.

## 3. Research Project: Logistic Regression vs Perceptron

## 4. Statistical Consultation Project: Effect of Wood Harvesting on *Bursera Simaruba* Population
