I am a Data Scientist/Machine learning Enginner at DataOn Corp Indonesia. I am currently designing a production machine learning system for predicting employee attrition risk. I graduated from University of Minnesota in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistical Science degree with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. Some of the things I like to do in my free time are playing sports such as badminton, table tennis, or soccer, as well as cooking or trying out different cuisines.
